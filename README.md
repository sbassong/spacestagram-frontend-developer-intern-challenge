### By: Sam Bassong

## **Description**

Spacestagram is an image-sharing app from the final frontier. Built as my submision for Shopify's frontend developer internship, this app uses NASA's API to source its images. 

## **Technologies**

* [Reactjs](https://reactjs.org/) / [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/)
*  Astronomy Picture of the Day API ([APOD](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api)) from [NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/)
* [Polaris](https://polaris.shopify.com/)
* HTML
* CSS

## **Libraries**
* [Axios-HTTP](https://axios-http.com/)

## **Getting Started**

This guide assume you're running the application on NodeJS runtime. You may download it the [official NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) or use your favorite package manager to do so.

* Copy this repo's SSH URL link and clone it on your local machine

* On your terminal, run `cd Spacestagram-FrontEnd-Developer-Intern-Challenge/client` to change directory into the cloned repo's react app directory 

* Run `npm install` or `npm i` to install the necessary depencies from the client directory's package.json

* Run `npm start` to launch the React app. The app should load on http://localhost:3000
